🌿 The Lore of Verdant Shards

“Life remembers. Magic listens. The Shards awaken.”

---

🌱 1. Origin — The Breath of the First Tree

Long before the Divine Elves carved their first rune, the world was shaped by a colossal, world‑spanning tree known as Elyndra, the First Tree.

When Elyndra shed her leaves each century, the fallen leaves did not rot.
They crystallized.

Those crystals were the first Verdant Shards.

The elves discovered that each shard still carried a faint echo of Elyndra’s life‑essence—an imprint of the world’s earliest magic.

This is why Verdant Shards are green, warm to the touch, and pulse faintly like a heartbeat.

🌿 2. Why Verdant Shards Are Magical

Verdant Shards are not “magic stones.”
They are living memories.

Each shard contains:

• A fragment of life‑essence

The same energy that fuels healing, growth, and regeneration.

• A dormant magical pattern

A natural “circuit” that can be awakened by carving runes.

• A stabilizing core

Without a shard, rune magic collapses instantly.

This is why every rune—no matter how simple—requires at least one shard.

🌳 3. How Runes Work (Lore Version)

When a rune is carved into a wooden tablet:

• The carving stone shapes the magical pattern
• The clay binds the pattern to the tablet
• The essence defines the rune’s purpose
• The Verdant Shard awakens the pattern and fuels it


The shard acts like a battery, soul, and blueprint all at once.

Without it, the rune is just a drawing.

With it, the rune becomes alive.

🍃 4. Why Verdant Shards Are Rare

Elyndra, the First Tree, is long gone.

Her roots still lie deep beneath the world, but she no longer sheds leaves.
The shards that exist today are:

• Remnants of ancient ages
• Crystallized memories of the world’s youth
• Fragments of a magic that no longer renews itself


This is why Verdant Shards are precious, finite, and deeply respected by elves.

🌲 5. Why Some Runes Cannot Be Crafted

Some runes—like teleportation, invisibility, or divine protection—require patterns that no mortal hand can carve.

These runes were created:

• By ancient elven sages
• By the First Tree herself
• Or by forgotten civilizations


Their patterns are too complex or too sacred to reproduce.

Thus:

• Common runes → craftable
• Rare runes → sometimes craftable
• Legendary/Mythic runes → only found, traded, or inherited


This gives the Grand Trade its prestige.

🌾 6. Why Verdant Shards Respond to the Hero

When the hero touches a shard for the first time, it glows faintly.

This is not random.

Verdant Shards respond to:

• Willpower
• Intent
• Life force


The hero’s journey begins with a spark of potential, and the shards recognize it.

This is why Fionne trusts the hero with rune knowledge so early.
