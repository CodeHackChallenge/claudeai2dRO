🌿 Rune Crafting System (Finalized Design)

Core Idea

Runes are magical items created by inscribing symbols into a prepared tablet using special materials.
They replace potions, provide buffs, resistances, and utility, and are a major part of your game’s identity.

---

🟩 1. Required Base Materials (All Craftable Runes)

Every craftable rune requires these core components:

1. Wooden Tablet

• The base surface where the rune is carved.
• Common, cheap, sold by NPCs.


2. Clay

• Used to bind the carving and stabilize the magic.
• Common, gathered from the environment.


3. Carving Stone

• The tool used to inscribe the rune.
• Slightly rarer; drops from stone‑type mobs or found in caves.


4. Verdant Shards (MOST IMPORTANT)

• The magical catalyst that activates the rune.
• Determines the power, rarity, and type of rune.
• The amount required scales with rune tier.


5. Rune Essence (Optional, depending on rune type)

This is what you meant by “depending on what rune you want to craft you have to include it.”

Examples:

• Fire Essence → Fire Resistance Rune
• Strength Essence → Strength Rune
• Wind Essence → Speed Rune
• Arcane Essence → Magic Rune
• Spirit Essence → Healing Rune


These essences define the rune’s identity.

🟦 2. Verdant Shard Requirements (Rune Tier Scaling)

Verdant Shards are the true bottleneck and the heart of the crafting economy.

Here’s a clean, balanced shard requirement curve:

Rune Tier	Example Rune	Shards Needed	
Common	Minor Strength, Minor Fortitude	1 shard	
Uncommon	Strength Rune, Fortitude Rune	3 shards	
Rare	Major Strength, Major Fortitude	7 shards	
Epic	Elemental Resistance Rune	15 shards	
Legendary	High‑tier utility runes	30 shards	
Mythic (Uncraftable)	Teleport Rune, Divine Rune	Cannot craft	


This gives you:

• A clear progression
• A meaningful grind
• A reason to hunt mobs and explore

🟧 3. Craftable vs. Non‑Craftable Runes

Craftable Runes

• Stat runes (ATK, DEF, HP regen, MP regen)
• Resistance runes (Fire, Ice, Lightning, Poison)
• Minor utility runes (speed, stamina regen, accuracy)


Non‑Craftable Runes

These are special and must be obtained through:

• Grand Trade (gold currency)
• Rare monster drops
• Events
• Bosses


Examples:

• Teleport Rune
• Rune of Return
• Rune of Invisibility
• Rune of Divine Protection
• Rune of Resurrection (if you ever add it)


This creates excitement and prestige around rare runes.

🟨 4. Rune Acquisition Sources

Local Merchant (Aurels currency)

• Sells Common and some Uncommon runes
• Sells crafting materials (wooden tablets, clay, carving stones)
• Sells low‑tier essences
• Uses Aurels (your NPC‑only currency)


Monster Drops

• Chance to drop:• Verdant Shards
• Essences
• Uncommon runes
• Rare runes (low chance)



Grand Trade (Gold currency)

• Player‑driven marketplace
• Uses Gold, not Aurels
• Sells:• Rare runes
• Epic runes
• Legendary runes
• Uncraftable special runes
• High‑tier essences
• Bulk Verdant Shards



This creates a two‑currency economy:

• Aurels → NPC shops
• Gold → Player economy + Grand Trade


This is extremely healthy for an MMO.
